Edge devices increasingly participate in various computations through advances in Fog computing. The network topology for Fog computing is highly dynamic with new nodes regularly joining and leaving the overall network architecture. The dynamic nature of the participants make trust in the network a hard quantity to establish. The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) offers meager protection against various forms of attacks. The resource-constrained nature of fog nodes prevents the use of heavyweight cryptographic algorithms to achieve secured communication. A lightweight mechanism is thus essential to impart security in Fog-IoT networks. Based on prior works, we use proxy behaviours to measure trust in a particular node and resort to a time-dependent trust analysis to provide a behavior-based analysis of entities in the system. This paper presents a lightweight Recommendation based Trust Mechanism and AIMD trust calculations with threshold cutoffs to further secure RPL communications.
