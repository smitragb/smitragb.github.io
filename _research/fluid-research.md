I worked on surveying and documenting various numerical schemes used to solve the ___Navier Stoke's Equation___ under re-entry conditions. These conditions are usually characterized with high temperatures, supersonic/hypersonic speeds for re-entry, and shock propagations due to fluid-structure interactions. The methods surveyed spanned various techiques such as Finite-Difference, Finite-Volume, and techniques that incorporated the kinetic theory of gases. Some examples of such schems include: _Roe, Godunov, TVD, Steger-Warming, CUSP_ etc. Although tangentially related, this work inspired my [project](https://github.com/Shashwatha-Mitra/double-slit-expt) on simulating the [Young's Double Slit Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) for particles in a box using Finite-Difference and Spectral methods
